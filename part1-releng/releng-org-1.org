* Problem space
** You need a personal online notebook
   + You need to document things you learn and do.
** You need to write a lengthy document with complex formatting
   + Markdown is too basic.
   + LaTeX is too hard to learn.
   + Word processor?  Surely you jest!
** You have a complex todo-list
   + Repeating events, deadlines, and dependencies
   + Each todo app stinks in a unique way.
* Solution: [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], “Your life in plain text”
  + Outliner, markup language, and personal organizer
  + Exports into several output formats: HTML, PDF, ODT, man page, and
    more.  The source format is plain text.
  + You’re looking at it!
* But, it’s Emacs.  Eww!
** Yeah, it’s Emacs.  Get over it!
   + ~C-h t~ → Emacs tutorial
** Attached to vi?
   + evil-mode → vi keybindings, install through MELPA
   + [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] → custom distribution with vi keybindings
* Basic org-mode
** Formatting
   + Typeset some things: Paragraph, list, image, table, code,
     checkboxes

   + HTML: supports style sheets
   + PDF: LaTeX, Beamer
   + ODT: for LibreOffice, supports templates

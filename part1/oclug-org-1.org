#+title: OCLUG org-mode demo, part 1
#+subtitle: Why org-mode?

* Problem space
** You need a personal online notebook
   + You are a serious computer user.
   + You need to document things you learn and do.
   + The notebook should be fast, simple, and easy to search.
   + Ideally, the notebook shouldn’t use a binary format.  (Plain text
     is generally good enough.)
** You need to write a lengthy document with complex formatting
   + Markdown doesn’t cut it.
   + Entry to LaTeX-land is too expensive.
   + Word processor?  Maybe, maybe not.
** You have a complex todo-list
   + Repeating events, several projects, arbitrary deadlines, and
     dependencies.
   + Each todo app has its own quirks, and you don’t like that.
   + Flat text file is inadequate.
* Solution: [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], “Your life in plain text”
  + What is org-mode?  Emacs elisp module, bundled with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]
  + Outliner, markup language, and personal organizer
  + You’re looking at it!
  + Exports into several output formats: HTML, PDF, ODT, man page, and
    more.  The source format is plain text.
* Basic Emacs
** Why?
   + If I don’t impress you with org-mode goodies, then I have failed.
   + I’m not going to say Emacs > Vim.
   + Comparison between Emacs and Vim?
     + Emacs is more like an IDE.
     + Lisp everywhere!
     + Graphical support
** ~C-h t~: the Emacs tutorial
   + It *will* make you Emacs-literate in a few hours.
   + ~C-h i~ displays the info page viewer: required for documentation
** Doom Emacs?  Spacemacs?
   + I have never used them.
   + Personal preference.  Maybe you might like them, or maybe not.
   + [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] is someone’s pre-canned configuration.
   + [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] is its own distribution.  Vim-like keybindings.
* Basic org-mode
** Formatting
   + Typeset some things: Paragraph, list, image, table, code
** Exports: HTML, PDF, ODT
   + HTML: demo style sheet
   + PDF: show the LaTeX output
   + ODT: Open in LibreOffice.  Show template support.
** Where is this going?
   + Show off the web site.
   + Show off the VPPR user guide.
   + Show off resumé.
